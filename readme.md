## How to enter paths to file

You can provide paths in two ways:
1. Via execution params
2. Via console input


### Execution params
Params should looks like: `dataPaths={PATH_TO_FILE}`. Several paths can be passed separated by `,`.

### Via Console input
Just type the path to the file. Only **one** path can be passed.
